Usage:

./sync --local
This will update the code directly through a browser hook. This works much faster
while editing code in simulation mode, and can even be used while offline.

cat sync.crx.b64 | base64 -D > sync.crx
This is an extension you can add to Chrome to avoid having to paste the bootstrap
line in each time.

./sync --auth 'username@example.com:password'
This will sync code via the Screeps Grunt API
